1. data preparation:
Used citibike data. Converted birth year data to age. Dropped age bigger than 85. 

2. plot the data
plotted data with normal distribution with same mean and standard deviation.
Made a regression of sample data to the most fitted lognormal curve. Identified the parameters of the curve and plotted them.

2. KS test
test wheter the age data draws from normal distribution using ks test.
Null hypothesis: citibikers age distribution draws from a normal distrubution
compare p-value to our set significance level. p value < significance leve,
reject null.

3. AD test 
test wheter the age data draws from normal distribution using AD test.
Null hypothesis: citibikers age distribution draws from a normal distrubution
compare Anderson statistics to critical value at our set significance level. Statistics > critical value.
reject null.

4. KS test
test wheter the age data draws from lognormal distribution using ks test.
Null hypothesis: citibikers age distribution draws from a lognormal distrubution
compare p-value to our set significance level. p value < significance leve,
reject null.

5. AD test 
test wheter the age data draws from gumbel distribution using AD test.
Null hypothesis: citibikers age distribution draws from a normal distrubution
compare Anderson statistics to critical value at our set significance level. Statistics > critical value.
reject null.

# assign 2 : discussed with Kaylyn(kal573). Helped Alexey(ka6129) with his work. 

1. data preparation 
read files from url. Created two dictionaries for males and females with keys referring to each ethnicity group holding each dataframe.
identified non-real numbers and converted them to NAN.

2. regression
Made a linear regression based on median income of all, white, asian, black, hispanics. And drew the plot.

3. regression
Made a linear regression based on median income of each income range from all, white, asian, black, hispanics. And drew the plot.

4. analyze
analyzed the plot and estimated the income of male and female at the same position.

formulated null and alternative hypothesis for each test.
