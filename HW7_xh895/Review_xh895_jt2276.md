Peer Review:

The plot above describes the air pollution levels of the top 10 offending countries and compares them to the global average.
The plot is easy to read, as the R-B colors contrast, and a legend is clearly labeled.
The numbers on top of the bars give increased clarity to the data.
The country labels are centered between the bars, making it slightly ambiguous as to which bar they refer to.
The plot is honestly reproducing the data without deformations.

The plot could be improved if the font size for the axes labels was increase, the country labels were centered under their respective bars, and a caption was included that explained the major takeaway of the figure.
