Assignment 1 : Worked on my own and discussed understanding of the question and approach with Mona and Kaylyn.

           With python's built in package, formed 100 sample set of different sizes ranging from 10 to 2000 of 5 distributions.
           Plot them by means and sample range for each kind of distributions. Formed a histogram suggesting the number of datasets for each sample mean value.
           From the two figures for each kind of distribution, think about their connection and reflection of the central theorem.
           
Assignment 2 : Worked with Mona(NM2773) and Kaylyn(kal573). We took a quick look at the data and decided which we wanted to dig into further.
           
           We formulated the hypothesis together. During the discussion group project study hours, Mona did the main coding. I followed her approach and understood the code.
           I did the coding for the hand-in homework.
           
Assignment 3: Worked on my own.
            
          Finished lab 3. With the 100 bus compute time data and known bus compute time mean and standard deviation, built a pypothesis that new time data is less than the old value.
          With hypothesis, built a statistical test with 0.05 significance level. Made a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis, calculated the z-value and decide whether or not to reject null hypothesis.
          Result shows that with 0.05 significance level, the test result reject null hypothesis. Thus, it's statistically evident that new bus compute time is less than old bus compute time.
